Watts attributes the traction gained by postmodern philosophy to the process of 'fragilization', a process where cultural and religious pluralism seems to make indifference of opinion the augmented standard belief. The motivation of which, he claims, is so it can be used as a debating strategy. He analogizes arguing with somebody who subscribes to postmodern thought as fighting with someone who has nothing to lose, as if we had something to lose in the first place? This is my first departure from Watt. Since when has the refinement of ideas, while done in good faith, implied a winner and a loser? If the criticisms brought forward stand on firm ground, ought we not to consider evaluating them? And if justificiations to those criticisms are incorporated and produce a more well thought out understanding of the discussion at hand, don't we all win? I see no harm in implementing a degree of the Socratic method to round out our beliefs. In response to Watts interpretation of "I have no worldview", it might be more so that no single world view is comprehensive enough.
